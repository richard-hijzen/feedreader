# Project Overview

In this project i made a couple of tests with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for a feedreader.
In the bottom of the page you can see which tests did succeed and failed.

## What did i test

* Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
* Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
* Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
* Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
* Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work.
* Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.

## How did i achieve this result

Thanks to the Udacity course i've had a good start and for the last missing pieces i had to do some research.
I found a lot of tips on the jasmine page and forums like stackoverflow.
