# Project Overview

In this project i made a couple of tests with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for a feedreader.
In the bottom of the page you can see which tests did succeed and failed. You can test it over here (https://richard-hijzen.github.io/feedreader).

## How did i achieve this result

Thanks to the Udacity course i've had a good start and for the last missing pieces i had to do some research.
I found a lot of tips on the jasmine page and forums like stackoverflow.
